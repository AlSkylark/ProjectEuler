# Project Euler, solutions by Alex Castro
This repository serves as a personal archive for my solutions to the Project Euler (located here: https://projecteuler.net/).
This is meant to be a way to show my progress as a beginner programmer and NOT a cheat sheet.

<b>BE AWARE:</b> The solutions in this repository/program, whether they are good, ok, bad or downright terrible will only be CORRECT answers.<br>
HENCE <b>I highly recommend</b> that you develop a solution yourself first, as looking it up (here or anywhere else) will spoil the fun and potential benefits of finding the solution of the problems by yourself!
